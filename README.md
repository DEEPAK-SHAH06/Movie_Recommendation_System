This is the project which implements the concept of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. 
I used movies dataset of tmdb which provides api for moview free.
Data was preprocessed in Google Colab in a ipynb file. 
Then the required files were pickled and imported to Folder of Local system. 
I used streamlit for frontend development and FastAPI for backend.
